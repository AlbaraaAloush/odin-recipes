        <li>Onions and a green chili pepper</li>
        <li>Spices</li>

        <li>
          Make the chicken stock by saut√©ing the onions and a green chili pepper
          in oil, and adding all the spices. Brown the chicken on all sides,
          then pour enough water on top to cover along with tomato paste. Boil
          for 20-25 minutes to make a chicken stock.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the chicken pieces on a roasting pan, and coat with the olive
          oil spice mixture. Roast at 400 F for 20-25 minutes until crisp and
          golden. Meanwhile, make the crispy onion, toasted nuts and raisin
          garnish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strain the chicken stock, and use that to cook the basmati rice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble by layering the rice in a serving dish and topping with the
          chicken pieces and the crispy onions, raisins and toasted nuts.
