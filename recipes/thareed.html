      <h1>What is Thareed</h1>
      <p>
        Thareed (or Tharid) is a Middle Eastern dish consisting of red meat
        chunks with vegetables and thick sauce from tomatoes and tomato paste,
        cooked slowly, and served over pita bread or flatbread. The term
        literally means “stewed beef with vegetables over bread.”

      <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use ghee instead of any cooking oil. If you are overwhelmed with the
          richness of ghee, you can mix 1 tbsp ghee with 2 tbsp of cooking oil
          and you are good to go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any Arabic spice blend is good for this dish. You can even create your
          own. Sometimes, I feel that the secret of the entire dish is from the
          Arabic spices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fry onion, rather than just sautee, i.e., lightly brown the onion
          during the initial steps of cooking for a more defined taste. The use
          of garlic is optional (my mother-in-law does not use it) as it adds
          aroma to the dish as well.
